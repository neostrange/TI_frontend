          <p class="text-muted"> Malware attacks are the major threats being faced by Pakistani organizations. Using the Internet, attackers employ
unique malware based techniques to infect their target systems for different reasons varying from creating mere
nuisance to stealing credentials to eavesdropping on communication to capturing proprietary and highly confidential
information.</br></br>
Attackers scan the Internet to look-out for vulnerable services and try to exploit them to gain access to the system and
ultimately the network. Often root-kits (type of malware) are used to take over and maintain control of a compromised
system. The following section of the report will present the latest trends of malware based attacks which were identified
based on the information gathered from our sensors during the month of <b>July</b>.</br></br>
The correlated information from different sensors reveals that there were more than <b>3,63,400</b> number of connection
attempts to Pakistan cyberspace from all over the world. Furthermore, we detected more than <b>70,200</b> materialized
attacks that were launched in this period. Over <b>3,500</b> unique IP addresses tried to establish a connection with our
deployed sensors through-out Pakistan for at-least one time.</br></br>
After thorough automated analysis and correlation, most of these connection attempts were classified as malicious
and were doing intense scanning for figuring out running services (particularly the vulnerable ones) over Pakistan
cyberspace.</br></br>
One of the top IP address that established most number of connections was found to be <b>184.106.144.135</b> with more than
<b>85,982</b> connections. The origin of this IP address was found to be <b>United States</b>. There were more than 1350 unique IP
addresses that succeeded in exploiting a particular vulnerability and uploaded some malware.</br></br>
One of the top IP addresses that initiated most number of attacks was found to be <b>178.45.161.150</b> with more than
<b>5450</b> successful attacks. The origin of this IP address was found to be Russia. The most number of attacks were
launched by exploiting <b>MS08-067, MS08-068, MS09-001</b> vulnerabilities, which could allow remote code execution.
Furthermore, as per our correlated information port <b>445</b> received the highest number of attack traffic with <b>66.0%</b>
of total attacks received. The service hosted on port <b>445</b> was <b>SMB</b> (Service Message Block) for Samba.</br></br>
Further information related to IP addresses trying to make connections and doing attacks, top malware found, top
vulnerabilities exploited and top protocol / services exploited is given below.</p>
