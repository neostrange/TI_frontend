          <p class="text-muted"> One of the most utilized messages that must be processed by SIP proxy servers is the INVITE message. The INVITE message
is used to establish a connection among two or more participants in a SIP session. Until this connection is established,
the SIP proxy must keep the connection state. This fact makes the proxy most vulnerable to flooding attacks. An attacker
can possibly launch a flooding attack by utilizing INVITE messages not only against a proxy, but also against an end-user’s
terminal.</br>
INVITE message flooding is also critical but only with higher rates. Even time required for a recovery of server after the attack
was longer in case of OPTION and REGISTER messages.
Following top IPs are found to be involved in flooding the proxy server and end-user terminal:  </p>
